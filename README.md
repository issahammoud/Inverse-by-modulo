# Inverse-by-modulo
I wrote this code several years ago and I like to share it with you.
It is a very efficient algorithm to calculate the inverse by modulo using Extended Euclidean algorithm. 
Note that inverse by modulo is used in cryptography with very big numbers.
There is a PDF written in french to explain the algorithm used.
